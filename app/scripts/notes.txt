Does a form contain new data?
I needed to implement a functionality that would warn the user about
changed data in a form when the user tried to navigate away from the form.
Luckily, in AngularJS this is very easy. You just use the $dirty variable. Just like so:


$scope.back = function($event, ConfirmBackText) {
  $event.preventDefault();
  if ($scope.mainform.$dirty) {
    if (confirm(ConfirmBackText)) {
      window.history.back();
    }
  } else {
    window.history.back();
  }
};
